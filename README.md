# WebScienceProj

The `twitterScript.py` file contains the entire code of the project.

Each question's code is contained in a separate cell.

For the best results, run the whole file from the beginning to the end.

While it is possible to run the 2nd and 3rd cells independently, it is necessary to run the 1st cell at least once before doing so, as it creates the `network-lastname.data` file required for the rest of the code to function properly.

The "myOutput" folder contains the pre-built `network-lastname.data` file as well as the files with three different centrality measures.

⚠️ WARNING: The 1st and 3rd cells can take a long time to run, potentially up to 40 minutes.

Code created with JetBrains DataSpell.
